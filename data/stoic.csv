"Let us see to it that the recollection of those we have lost becomes a pleasure to us",209

"I should prefer to see you abandoning grief than it abandoning you",212

"Now all art is an imitation of nature",217
"It is the same with all things: they consist of something which comes into being and something else which brings them into being",217
"What was the cause of God’s creating the universe? He is good, and whoever is good can never be grudging with anything good; so he made it as good a world as it was in his power to make it",220
"Accessory causes are infinite in number; what we are after is the general cause",222
"For to it this body of ours is a burden and a torment",223
"The wise man and devotee of philosophy is needless to say inseparable from his body, and yet he is detached from it so far as the best part of his personality is concerned, directing his thoughts towards things far above",224
"And he is so made that he neither loves life nor hates it. He endures the lot of mortality even though he knows there is a finer one in store for him.",224

"Drunkenness inflames and lays bare every vice, removing the reserve that acts as a check on impulses to wrong behaviour",262
"Explain, then, why the good man should avoid getting drunk, using facts, not words, to show its ugliness and offensiveness. Prove – and an easy task it is – that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments…. ",263
